Hey, I've made a short list of features that are currently available on the site.
Theres a folder called [How Do I See It] to show you how i saw it when i developed and designed the site.
The name s1, s2 , s3, etc.. are name of pictures in this folder.

Main Page[Image s1]:
- Created a name that went through my mind and added a small icon to make it look like a professional logo.
- Changing words under main title - used animation.
- Log In/Sign Up Buttons are available on navbar and under Main Title.
- Floating image on the right side of the screen with floating animation.

Sign Up Page[Images s2]:
- Clean sing up form made from inputs.
- Reset Form Button with double click confirmation(and a small alert).
- Data is save on Session Storage.

Log In Page [Images s3, s4]:
- Clean login up form made from inputs.
- Login using Username and Password taken from Session Storage.
- Wrong Password alert.

To Do Page [Images s5, s6, s7]:
- Welcoming user on top right page.
- Change background button(Will lead you to change background function Image S6).
- Choosing any image will change the background image.
- User name on welcome message will change color according to chosen background image.
- 3 Main Panels: Add New Task, To Do, Done.
- Add New Task allows you to do several stuff:
	- Add a new task
	- Detarmain the priorirt of the task{low, medium, high}
	- Show Tasks button to display all new tasks.
	- Sorting, High to Low, Low to High, and by Name(a,b).
- Clear Done Column, as in the name, will remove the Done Column after confirmation.
When clicking the Clear Done Column button, you are displayed with another button "Are You Sure?", clicking it will clear the column.

** Known bug, clicking 2-3 Delete buttons will leave the first "Are You Sure" button on.
