Hey, I've made a short list of currently available features on the site.
There's a folder called [How Do I See It] to show you how I saw it when I developed and designed the site.
The names s1, s2 , s3, etc.. are the names of the pictures in this folder.

# Features #
### Main Page[Image s1]: ###
- Created a name that went through my mind and added a small icon to make it look like a professional logo.
- Changing words under the main title - used animation.
- Log In/Sign Up Buttons are available on the navbar and under Main Title.
- Floating image on the right side of the screen with floating animation.

### Sign Up Page[Images s2]: ###
- Clean sign-up form made from inputs.
- Reset Form Button with double-click confirmation(and a small alert).
- Data is saved on Session Storage.

### Log In Page [Images s3, s4]: ###
- Clean login up form made from inputs.
- Log in using Username and Password taken from Session Storage.
- Wrong Password alert.
- Username does not exist alert.
- When inputs are correct, loading with animation and gif are displayed.

### To Do Page [Images s5, s6, s7]: ###
- Welcoming users on the top right page.
- Change background button(Will lead you to change background function Image S6).
- Choosing any image will change the background image.
- The user name on the welcome message will change color according to the chosen background image.
- 3 Main Panels: Add New Task, To Do, Done.
- Add New Task allows you to do several stuff:
	- Add a new task
	- Determine the priority of the task{low, medium, high}
	- Show Tasks button to display all new tasks.
	- Sorting, High to Low, Low to High, and by Name(a,b).
- Clear the Done Column, as in the name, will remove the Done Column after confirmation.
When clicking the Clear Done Column button, you are displayed with another button "Are You Sure?", clicking it will clear the column.

- To Do shows you the cards, able to delete a card(with confirmation of "Are you sure?").
** Known bug, clicking 2-3 Delete buttons will leave the first "Are You Sure" button on.
- Move the button to move the card to the "Done" column.
- Hovering over the priority color will display the text, and you will be able to see it on image S7.

** Word was just changed(animation) that's why it is blurry.
